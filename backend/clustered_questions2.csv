🟢 Rarely Asked,"Q.2 (b) To the Internal Revenue Service, the reasonableness of total itemized deductions depends 10
on the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Large deductions, which include charity and
medical deductions, are more reasonable for taxpayers with large adjusted gross
incomes. If a taxpayer claims larger than average itemized deductions for a given level
of income, the chances of an IRS audit are increased. Data (in thousands of Rs) on
adjusted gross income and the average or reasonable amount of itemized deductions
follow.
